    <p class="center"> Hello. My name is Darlene Leslie. I was born and raised in Arizona. I have a family of five. My two youngest children are continuing their elementary education, while my oldest has just started jr. high school. My husband and I have been married for, four years. He is now working toward a degree within the environmental sciences.</p>
    <p class="center">I have a diverse background. I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from Fort Lewis College. With this degree, I was able to dabble in biology, art, law, and education. My endorsement focus was elementary education K-6. I started teaching public education, in 2014. My interest grew with the Montessori Method. As a result, I went through formal training and became a certified Montessori teacher with the American Montessori Society. I enjoy teaching kids using the Montessori Method. My long term goal is to work with the Native American community in building Montessori schools. I found an interest in computer coding because I felt that it would be helpful with developing communication tools for the public, teachers, and adminstrators. I plan to complete my computer coding training, in December, from the University of Arizona. </p>
    <p class="center">Besides my passion for learning, I love to hike, dance, and spend time with my family.</p>
